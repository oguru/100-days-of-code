# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 20.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Did a few codingame live challenges and continued to work on the skynet revolution puzzle. I managed to get half of the tests to pass and should be able to complete it next time I work on it. Started creating a pre-existing allotment website in React and created some base components. Continued reading Javascript.info ebook - Object methods and completed the 2 exercises.

**Thoughts:**: The skynet challenge is pushing me to think in new ways which is good. I will try to do more of the allotment website tomorrow though, perhaps I spent a little too long "productively procrastinating" on codingame.
