# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 20.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Did a few codingame live challenges and continued to work on the skynet revolution puzzle. I managed to get half of the tests to pass and should be able to complete it next time I work on it. Started creating a pre-existing allotment website in React and created some base components. Continued reading Javascript.info ebook - Object methods and completed the 2 exercises.

**Thoughts:**: The skynet challenge is pushing me to think in new ways which is good. I will try to do more of the allotment website tomorrow though, perhaps I spent a little too long "productively procrastinating" on codingame.

**Time Spent**: Around 5 hours.


### Day 2: 21.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the time on the allotment website. Read up on React Router and React Bootstrap to try in this project and started to implement. Did a few codingame clashes and a little more work on the skynet puzzle.

**Thoughts**: I used normal Bootstrap in the original Umbraco project and didn't realise React Bootstrap comes with a little more of a learning curve, so I didn't get to do as much coding as I'd have liked but I have gotten started. I am surprised at my progress on the codingame live clashes recently, my Javascript reading over the holidays has improved my skills significantly, it's saying i'm now in the top 3%!

**Time Spent**: 9 hours.


### Day 3: 22.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Designed and built an encryption/decryption coding challenge for codingame (not published yet as there is an issue with unicode). Did quite a few live clashes of code and spent some more time on the skynet puzzle.

**Thoughts**: Wasn't feeling up to working on the allotment site so I did the above. It was fun creating a challenge, I went through many ideas and versions before settling on the one I finished. The skynet puzzle is still only passing half the tests but I did make some breakthroughs in my understanding of it and refactored a lot.

**Time Spent**: 7.5 hours.
