# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 20.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Did a few codingame live challenges and continued to work on the skynet revolution puzzle. I managed to get half of the tests to pass and should be able to complete it next time I work on it. Started creating a pre-existing allotment website in React and created some base components. Continued reading Javascript.info ebook - Object methods and completed the 2 exercises.

**Thoughts:**: The skynet challenge is pushing me to think in new ways which is good. I will try to do more of the allotment website tomorrow though, perhaps I spent a little too long "productively procrastinating" on codingame.

**Time Spent**: Around 5 hours.


### Day 2: 21.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the time on the allotment website. Read up on React Router and React Bootstrap to try in this project and started to implement. Did a few codingame clashes and a little more work on the skynet puzzle.

**Thoughts**: I used normal Bootstrap in the original Umbraco project and didn't realise React Bootstrap comes with a little more of a learning curve, so I didn't get to do as much coding as I'd have liked but I have gotten started. I am surprised at my progress on the codingame live clashes recently, my Javascript reading over the holidays has improved my skills significantly, it's saying i'm now in the top 3%!

**Time Spent**: 9 hours.


### Day 3: 22.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Designed and built an encryption/decryption coding challenge for codingame (not published yet as there is an issue with unicode). Did quite a few live clashes of code and spent some more time on the skynet puzzle.

**Thoughts**: Wasn't feeling up to working on the allotment site so I did the above. It was fun creating a challenge, I went through many ideas and versions before settling on the one I finished. The skynet puzzle is still only passing half the tests but I did make some breakthroughs in my understanding of it and refactored a lot.

**Time Spent**: 7.5 hours.


### Day 4: 23.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Skynet puzzle

**Thoughts**: Didn't get much time today so i worked on the skynet puzzle on codingame again. It is more difficult than i anticipated! I've rewritted the code in a different way as I worked out what I was doing before couldn't work.

**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours.


### Day 5: 24.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Skynet puzzle on Codingame

**Thoughts**: I think this puzzle might make me go insane but i'm loving it, it's going to be so satisfying when I crack it! It's getting confusing naming and keeping track of things but it's making me think more about structure and how to optimise it.

**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours.


### Day 6: 25.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Did some work on the allotment website and a little on codingame.

**Thoughts**: Had some issues with CSS today, I have been focusing on Javascript which has improved but CSS and React may need some attention. Was also quite tired so wasn't as efficient as I normally am.

### Day 7: 26.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Did some work on the allotment website and completed the Skynet puzzle.

**Time Spent**: 5 hours


### Day 8: 27.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Reworked my Clash of Code puzzle and submitted it on Codingame. Started 2 other puzzles on there.

**Thoughts**: Happy with the outcome but not sure if it's too complicated for a 5-15 minute challenge.

**Link(s) to work**: https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/614688ae4491baff55b789b50e736aebfe0e

**Time Spent**: 5.5 hours


### Day 9: 28.01.21

**Today's Progress**: Acted on feedback from my Clash of Code puzzle, reworked it and re-submitted it on Codingame. Did some work on allotment site.

**Thoughts**: Spent a lot of time on reworking the puzzle which was a little frustrating as it was mostly finding correct values for the new documentation. I decided to back out from using bootstrap react as it was taking too long to do anything due to having to constantly check documentation. The goal was to make something quickly rather than learn something new. Not the most productive day in terms of results but that's ok.
